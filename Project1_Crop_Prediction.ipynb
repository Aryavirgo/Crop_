Machine learning (ML) is an essential approach for achieving practical and effective solutions for this problem..Crop Prediction involves predicting the type of crop from available  data like weather parameter,soil parameter and the npk content.This project focus on predicting the type of the crop based on the existing data by using differnt machine learning algorithms.\n",
